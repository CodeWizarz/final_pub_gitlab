<h2 id=attention>Attention</h2>
<p>Versions 13.3.3, 13.2.7, and 13.1.9 were improperly packaged and did not contain
the security fixes outlined below. We've released 13.3.4, 13.2.8, and 13.1.10 to
correct the packaging error. See <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/delivery/-/issues/1176">#1176</a> for
details and corrective actions on the packaging error.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Today we are releasing versions 13.3.4, 13.2.8 and 13.1.10 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).</p>
<p>These versions contain important security fixes, and we strongly recommend that all GitLab installations be upgraded to one of these versions immediately.</p>
<p>GitLab releases patches for vulnerabilities in dedicated security releases. There are <a href="/security/#gitlab-security-releases">two types of security releases</a>: a monthly, scheduled security release, released a week after the feature release (which deploys on the 22nd of each month), and ad-hoc security releases for critical vulnerabilities. You can see all of our regular and security release blog posts <a href="/releases/categories/releases/">here</a>. In addition, the issues detailing each vulnerability are made public on our <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=security&amp;scope=all&amp;state=opened">issue tracker</a> 30 days after the release in which they were patched.</p>
<p>We are dedicated to ensuring all aspects of GitLab that are exposed to customers or that host customer data are held to the highest security standards. As part of maintaining good security hygiene, it is highly recommended that all customers upgrade to the latest security release for their supported version. You can read more <a href="/blog/2020/05/20/gitlab-instance-security-best-practices/">best practices in securing your GitLab instance</a> in our blog post.</p>
