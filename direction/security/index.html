<h2 id=section-overview>Section Overview</h2>
<p>The Sec Section focuses on providing security and compliance visibility across the entire software development lifecycle and is
comprised of the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/secure/">Secure</a> and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/govern/">Govern</a>
stages of the DevOps lifecycle. This is accomplished by <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/security/#shift-left-no-more-left-than-that">shifting security testing left</a> with the Secure stage, enabling developers to begin security scanning with their first written line of code, and by providing organizations with visibility and control over the security risk present across their environment with the Govern stage.</p>
<h3 id=gitlab-and-the-devsecops-lifecycle>GitLab and the DevSecOps Lifecycle</h3>
<p>GitLab is uniquely positioned to fully support DevSecOps by providing a single application for the entire software development lifecycle. This includes both shifting Application Security Testing (AST) left as well as providing visibility and control over security and compliance findings, from first line of code to production.</p>
<p><img src="/images/direction/sec/DevSecOps_Lifecycle.png" alt="DevSecOps Lifecycle"/></p>
<p>GitLab’s single application maps directly to the DevSecOps lifecycle. GitLab's Secure Stage focuses on pinpointing vulnerabilities and weaknesses, from development to production, while the Govern Stage provides visibility and control over the security &amp; compliance findings Secure detects. Together, GitLab supports all teams involved in delivering secure applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop: Developers create new source code, including new features and bug fixes, and commit this code to a branch within the project. This step is supported by the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/create/">Create</a> stage of the DevOps lifecycle, providing developers with <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/source-code-management/">source code management</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/ide/web_ide/">code editors</a>, and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/create/">code review</a> workflows.</li>
<li>Analyze: Upon code commit, Secure scanners kick off automatically and identify any new security findings with the delta code change. This enables developers to stay within context, enabling them to understand the cause and effect of their code change. Secure scanners leverage the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/verify/">Verify</a> stage of the DevOps lifecycle to provide scanning within the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/features/continuous-integration/">CI pipeline</a>.</li>
<li>Mitigate: Developers are provided with the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/index.html#interacting-with-the-vulnerabilities">details needed</a> to understand how to remediate the newly introduced security findings. Developers are also offered <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/index.html#resolve-a-vulnerability">automatic remediation</a>, where applicable.</li>
<li>Protect: Secure scanners provide continuous scanning coverage for applications deployed to production and Govern dashboards, policies, and compliance frameworks help users security findings and compliance requirements across their organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=lowering-the-cost-of-remediation>Lowering the Cost of Remediation</h3>
<p>The earlier a security vulnerability can be remediated has both risk reduction and cost reduction benefits.</p>
<p><img src="/images/direction/sec/Cost_Of_Remediation.png" alt="Cost of Remediation"/></p>
<p>When security vulnerabilities are identified at the time of code commit, developers can understand how their newly
introduced code has led to this new issue. This gives the developer a cause-and-effect enabling quicker resolution
while not having the time hit of context switching. This is not true as security scanning is performed later in the
software development lifecycle. New vulnerabilities may not be identified until weeks or months after they were added
to the application while under development.</p>
<p>Time is not the only savings when shifting security left.</p>
<p><img src="/images/direction/sec/Stage_of_Remediation.png" alt="Stage of Remediation"/></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/director/planning/report02-3.pdf">“The Economic Impacts of Inadequate Infrastructure for Software Testing”</a>, NIST estimated the cost of remediating software bugs at $59.5 billion/year. This is compounded when taking in the average time to remediate software bugs. In <a href="https://www.fullstacklabs.co/blog/software-development-price-guide-hourly-rate-comparison">“Software Development Price Guide &amp; Hourly Rate Comparison”</a>, FullStack Labs estimates the average cost of a software developer at $300/hour. The following table outlines the cost to remediate software bugs at different stages of the software development lifecycle:</p>
<p><img src="/images/direction/sec/costs_table.png" alt="Completed Loop"/></p>
<p>These costs are just the start of the financial impact when the software bug is also a software vulnerability. IBM, in partnership with the Ponemon Institute, put the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/digital-assets/cost-data-breach-report/#/">average cost to remediate a data breach in 2020</a> at $3.86 million (USD). This does not take into consideration the reputation impact to the organization.</p>
<h3 id=closing-the-loop>Closing the Loop</h3>
<p>Having visibility into security risk in just development only provides you with half of the picture. Development and
SecOps teams need to have a closed feedback loop enabling both teams to be successful. Development teams can gain
insight into attacks targeting the applications they develop. This allows them to prioritize vulnerabilities correctly,
enabling proactive resolutions to reduce risk. Likewise, SecOps teams can gain insight from their development
counterparts, providing them with visibility into how the application works. This allows them to best apply proactive
measures to mitigate attacks targeting the application until development can fix the vulnerability.</p>
<p><img src="/images/direction/sec/Completed_Loop.png" alt="Completed Loop"/></p>
<p>Closing the loop requires close collaboration, transparency, and efficiencies that only a single platform for the entire DevOps lifecycle can provide. Shifting security left while also providing protection for applications in production within a single application empowers teams to work closer together. <a href="https://ddesanto-update-sec-direction-fy21q4.about.gitlab-review.app/direction/security/#security-is-a-team-effort">Security is a team sport</a> and teams working together can best reduce their organization’s overall security risk.</p>
<h3 id=groups>Groups</h3>
<p>The Security Section is made up of two DevOps stages, Secure and Govern, and seven groups supporting the major categories of DevSecOps including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Composition Analysis</strong> - Assess your applications and services by analyzing dependencies for vulnerabilities and weaknesses, confirming only approved licenses are in use, and scanning your containers for vulnerabilities and weaknesses.</li>
<li><strong>Static Analysis</strong> - Assess your applications and services by scanning your source code for vulnerabilities and weaknesses.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Analysis</strong> - Assess your applications and services while they are running by leveraging the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/">Review App</a> available as part of GitLab’s CI/CD functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Threat Insights</strong> - Holistically view, manage, and reduce potential risks across the entire DevSecOps lifecycle, including Security Merge Request Views, Pipeline Security Reports, and Security Dashboards at the Project, Group, and Instance level.</li>
<li><strong>Security Policies</strong> - Apply policies to enforce scans and to require security approvals when vulnerabilities are found.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance</strong> - Provide users with the tools and features necessary to manage their compliance programs.</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerability Research</strong> - Leverage GitLab research to empower your Secure results by connecting security findings to industry references like <a href="https://cve.mitre.org">CVE IDs</a>.</li>

<h2 id=3-year-section-themes>3 Year Section Themes</h2>
<h3 id=security-is-a-team-effort>Security Is A Team Effort</h3>
<p>Everyone benefits when security is a team effort as testing happens regularly, issues are found earlier, and code shipped is more secure. To make this possible, security must be approachable, not overburden teams, and results must be easy to interpret. Security testing tools and processes must be <a href="https://www.gartner.com/document/code/450792?ref=ddisp&amp;refval=450792">adapted to your developers</a> (and not the other way around). This means bringing security into the workflow of your developers such that they can stay within their context without having unnecessary steps added to their daily work. Furthermore, results provided as security findings must be presented in a way that they can be interpreted without needing a PhD in cybersecurity. This includes providing enough detail to begin identifying the root cause (including identifying the section of code causing the security finding) and suggesting remediation steps (including <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/secure/#automatic-remediation">automatic remediation</a>) as well as pointing to industry standards related to the security finding. By implementing an integrated DevSecOps lifecycle with actionable results, security becomes everyone’s responsibility.</p>
<p>As examples, GitLab will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security findings within the merge request view allowing developers to stay within their context.</li>
<li>Security gates enabling the ability to require approval to merge when security findings are above a pre-set severity.</li>
<li>Industry references with security findings to aid in root cause analysis and remediation.</li>
<li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/secure/#automatic-remediation">Automatic remediation</a>, where applicable, enabling faster resolution of security findings.</li>
<li>Summary views, or dashboards, showing the overall health of the project, group, and instance enabling security teams to contribute and interact with development teams.</li>
<li>Historical reporting for security findings such that root cause can be identified and addressed, preventing recurring issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=shift-left-no-more-left-than-that>Shift Left. No, More Left Than That.</h3>
<p>The “shift left” approach is not a new concept within software testing and DevOps best practices. It is commonly thought of when discussing the <a href="https://www.devsecops.org/blog/2016/5/20/-security">DevSecOps lifecycle</a>. This usually includes security testing earlier in the software development lifecycle with the goal of identifying security vulnerabilities and weaknesses prior to shipping code to operations. Today’s techniques include static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), interactive application security testing (IAST), dependency scanning, and license compliance. The continuation of the “shift left” approach requires a harder shift left, bringing security testing as close as possible to the developer. This enables earlier detection of security vulnerabilities and weaknesses, thus lowering the cost of remediation (as well as reducing work for the entire team as security findings are addressed prior to reaching the QA and security teams).</p>
<p>As examples, GitLab will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static analysis beyond traditional SAST functionality, enabling more ways to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing">white-box test</a> source code.</li>
<li>Expanded identification functionality, enabling secret detection beyond API tokens, passwords, and cryptographic keys with improved secrets management leveraging cloud-native technologies.</li>
<li>Real-time feedback to developers via integrated development environments (IDEs), enabling developers to write secure code prior to code commit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=shift-right-yes-right-right-into-operations>Shift Right. Yes, Right. Right Into Operations.</h3>
<p>Security testing doesn’t stop once code is shipped. New vulnerabilities, security weaknesses and, attacker techniques are constantly discovered, leaving operations and their associated applications and services open to being compromised. Also, as organizations continue to shift to the cloud and employ cloud-native strategies, new attack surfaces are exposed that did not exist within the traditional data center. These include items like cloud storage permissions and unwanted network services. Applications, services, and their associated cloud-native infrastructure need to be assessed just as a user (or an attacker) would interact with them. This means performing the same tasks that an attacker would perform including reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing. Implementing a continuous assessment strategy of operations is needed to provide full visibility into all potential risk.</p>
<p>As examples, GitLab will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic analysis categories, including DAST and DAST API, providing the ability to assess the operations side of the DevOps lifecycle.</li>
<li>New categories purposefully designed to assess the operations network including automatic penetration testing and vulnerability assessment functionality.</li>
<li>Cloud-native assessment capabilities allowing users to truly understand their attack surface.</li>
<li>Active monitoring of public key infrastructure (PKI), providing full visibility into the cryptographic health of your cloud-native environment (and associated containers).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=provide-active-intelligence-to-enable-data-driven-decisions>Provide Active Intelligence to Enable Data-Driven Decisions</h3>
<p>Security findings, without context, can lead to making incorrect decisions on remediation, leaving applications and services vulnerable. With more data made available, better decisions can be made while prioritizing security findings, enabling users to best manage their security risk. Furthermore, this enables developers to write secure code, build operations to package dependencies free of vulnerabilities, and security team members to test deeper than previously achievable. Leveraging machine learning provides active intelligence, enabling users to make smart, data-driven decisions at the right time, lowering overall security risk. Machine learning, to be successful, relies on big data to build accurate models. The GitLab community includes developers, build operators, and security teams all working together within their organizations to code, build, deliver and secure application and services going into operations. As a global community, developers can learn from each other to identify and better secure code. Dependency vulnerabilities and weaknesses can be avoided, and security teams can test smarter, faster, and deeper. Machine learning, powered by anonymized data, provides active intelligence enabling data-driven decisions.</p>
<p>As examples, GitLab will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine learning that will be opt-in when it relates to using anonymized user data from the GitLab community.</li>
<li>Actionable intelligence to identify insecure coding practices to help developers write more secure code in real-time.</li>
<li>Dynamic application security testing (DAST) tailored to the application or service being tested, identifying security findings which may have been missed with traditional testing techniques.</li>
<li>Real-time data about software vulnerabilities and weaknesses related to technologies used within users’ projects, groups, and instances.</li>
<li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/secure/#automatic-remediation">Automatic remediation</a> of discovered software vulnerabilities and weaknesses within project source code, dependencies (e.g., libraries and packages), and containers.</li>
<li>Autogeneration of signatures and policies to address security findings within Secure Stage categories that can be automatically applied to Govern Stage categories.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=byot---bring-your-own-security-tools>BYOT - Bring Your Own (Security) Tools</h3>
<p>At GitLab, we believe everyone can contribute and security is everyone’s responsibility. We empower GitLab users by providing security tools which include Static Analysis, Dynamic Analysis, Container Scanning, Dependency Scanning, and License Scanning. However, we recognize our users may have existing security tools and may want to continue to use them. As such, we strive to play well with others. Security tool vendors will be provided standardized components (e.g., APIs) within the GitLab complete DevOps platform enabling easy integration into our Security Dashboard and Merge Request controls including security approvals. This allows our users to have alternate security tools that either replace, or augment, our Secure tools.</p>
<p>As examples, GitLab will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>A walkthrough (e.g., wizard) enabling users the ability to configure and enable integrations they wish to use as part of their DevSecOps processes.</li>
<li>Standardize REST APIs, following CRUD principles, for integrating third-party security scanners the ability to start scanning via GitLab CI/CD as well as submit their security findings into the GitLab complete DevOps platform.</li>
<li>Security vulnerability reporting framework, following JSON notation, allowing third-party security scanners to submit their security findings in such a way that their results can be integrated into Secure’s Security Dashboard and Merge Request controls including security approvals.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/">contributing</a> such an integration, please <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/new?nav_source=navbar">create an issue</a> so we can collaborate on questions and adding any enabling functionality.</p>
<h3 id=ai-will-scale-security-teams>AI will scale Security teams</h3>
<p>Generative AI will empower small, centralized security teams to scale and effectively support their companies' development organizations, even when those teams are outnumbered 250:1. AI can enhance security teams' effectiveness, efficiency, and overall cost-effectiveness by being integrated into their daily operations. Additionally, AI will play a crucial role in helping companies shift security left, allowing developers to participate in vulnerability management and overall risk reduction.</p>
<p>When it comes to vulnerability and dependency management two problems are hard to solve that could be solved with AI:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Triage.</strong> Triage takes a lot of time, context, and domain knowledge. Can this vulnerability be exploited? Is my company at risk? Does this vulnerability need to be mitigated? Where does this dependency exist in my organization? What do I need to fix first? <em>GitLab will use AI to provide suggestions on focus areas within your project and group to jumpstart the triage process.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mitigation.</strong> GitLab surfaces vulnerabilities that contain relevant information, however, more often users aren't sure where to start. It takes time to research and synthesize information that is surfaced within the vulnerability record. Moreover it can be difficult to figure out how to fix a given vulnerability. <em>GitLab will provide AI-assisted explanations and suggested remediations for vulnerabilities from SAST and DAST outputs.</em></li>
</ol>
<h3 id=top-down-security-controls>Top-down security controls</h3>
<p>Security teams need centralized management for their security and compliance workflows. Features such as user management, compliance labels, security policies, and the vulnerability and dependency lists need to allow for centralized management that applies across all of an organization's projects.</p>
<h3 id=no-compromises-with-compliance>No compromises with compliance</h3>
<p>Govern capabilities will ensure that compliance regulations are strictly followed in a way that they cannot be bypassed without the proper approvals. This includes providing the necessary tools to audit, monitor, and manage the compliance controls that are enforced.</p>
<h3 id=coordinate-governance-across-gitlab>Coordinate governance across GitLab</h3>
<p>Govern capabilities will serve as a connection point for a seamless workflow spanning across the DevSecOps lifecycle. By enabling collaboration between types of users, Govern can help solidify the advantages GitLab has to offer as a single application. For example, these areas might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitating a continuous experience for scanning across repositories, registries, and production environments.</li>
<li>Centralizing security and compliance controls across GitLab, including merge request approvals, anomalous user activity, and anomalous pipeline/job activity.</li>
<li>Leveraging data about production environment configuration to reduce false positives in scanners.</li>
<li>Leveraging data about vulnerabilities in development to inform and drive threat mitigation in production.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=emphasize-usability-and-convention-over-configuration>Emphasize usability and convention over configuration</h3>
<p>Govern capabilities will be <a href="/handbook/product/product-principles/#convention-over-configuration">pre-configured with reasonable defaults</a> out-of-the-box whenever possible. When not possible, they will be easy to configure either through code or through a guided UI workflow that is friendly to users without coding knowledge. Regardless of how the capabilities are configured, they will be stored as code for ease of management.</p>
<p>For example, GitLab's <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/policies/#policy-editor">security policy editor</a> supports editing policies in both a <code>rule mode</code> and in <code>yaml mode</code>.</p>
<h3 id=secure-the-software-supply-chain>Secure the software supply chain</h3>
<p>Govern capabilities allow organizations to lock down every aspect of their supply chain. This includes securely authenticating users into GitLab, hardening the GitLab platform itself, and verifying every step along the DevSecOps lifecycle as code is created, built, and deployed.</p>
<h2 id=1-year-plan>1 Year Plan</h2>
<h3 id=what-we-recently-completed>What We Recently Completed</h3>
<p>The Sec team has been actively delivering updates to help you reduce risk. The following are some highlights from recent GitLab releases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semgrep-based Scanning by Default.</strong> We recently hit a major milestone in our Semgrep consolidation. In GitLab 15.4, we swapped over to semgrep-based scanning by default for analyzing JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Go, Python, and Java code.</li>
<li><strong>DAST Moved to Complete Maturity.</strong> We recently achieved complete maturity with our DAST category.</li>
<li><strong>Browser-based DAST Passive Attack Parity.</strong> GitLab's browser-based DAST scanner is now at parity with respect to the OWASP ZAP passive attack library. The scanner itself provides substantial gains in terms of speed and coverage for single-page applications. This version of the scanner will be released in GA in the coming months, as the team continues to work on meeting active attack parity next.</li>
<li><strong>Inline Security Training.</strong> In early 2022, we released an inline security training capability that allows developers to connect to context-based training content directly from the MR experience. This provides a tight loop between practical tasks that developers need to complete (i.e., fixing vulnerable code) and security knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Dependency Paths.</strong> We recently added information about the shortest dependency path for findings identified in your projects. This improvement makes it easier for you to triage findings and to determine the steps to resolve vulnerabilities in your open source dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=what-we-are-currently-working-on>What We Are Currently Working On</h3>
<p>The Sec team is actively working to bring world class security to DevSecOps and the following outlines where we are currently investing our efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application Security Testing (AST) Leadership</strong> - We will take a leadership position within the Application Security Testing (AST) market. This will be accomplished by focusing on moving the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/secure/composition-analysis/software-composition-analysis/">Software Composition Analysis</a> and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/govern/threat_insights/vulnerability_management/">Vulnerability Management</a> categories to <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/maturity/">Complete</a> maturity.</li>
<li><strong>Dogfooding</strong> - We will <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/practice-what-you-preach">“practice what we preach”</a>, including leveraging Secure Categories in all things GitLab does. This tight circle will provide immediate feedback and increase our rate of learning.</li>
<li><strong>Security for everyone</strong> - In order to make security accessible to everyone across the DevOps lifecycle, we will bring all Secure OSS scanners to Core (self-managed) / Free (GitLab.com).</li>
<li><strong>Security and Compliance Visibility</strong> - Provide a unified user experience for viewing, triaging, and resolving security findings across the development lifecycle, while also enabling security policy and compliance requirement management across development, staging, and production.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=whats-next-for-us>What's Next For Us</h3>
<p>To meet our <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission/#big-hairy-audacious-goal">audacious goals</a>, the Sec Section will focus on the following over the next 12 months:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Differentiate on value</strong> - Running a security test is just the beginning. GitLab's unique visibility into the full picture of application code, configuration, and behavior puts us in a unique position to do many things: connect findings across scanning disciplines for higher-fidelity results, better evaluate the true risk of a finding, tie findings and behaviors back to the original code and code owners, and so on. We will start to leverage this advantaged position to develop value-add capabilities that only a platform like GitLab can offer.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Software Supply Chain Security (SSCS)</strong> - SSCS has become a top priority for most organizations in the wake of multiple software supply chain attacks in the last 2 years. GitLab is uniquely positioned to bring unique visibility, comprehensive coverage, and a world-class user experience to bear on this very difficult problem. We will be dedicating resources across various of the product to execute on our <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/supply-chain/">SSCS vision</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Holistic developer-first experience</strong> - We will capitalize on a unique opportunity to present results and activate workflows for developers and security professionals that standalone security products cannot replicate. We want to provide a first-class experience and enable users to make data-driven decisions to secure their applications and services as well as their enterprise. Our <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/#gitlab-security-dashboard">Security Dashboards</a> and <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/index.html#security-approvals-in-merge-requests">Merge Request Approvals</a> is just the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-stage Security Policy Management</strong> - Allowing users to configure and manage security policies in a unified manner across their GitLab Workspace. This includes managing policies for applications running in production (such as managing network policies) as well as managing policies that specify when scans should be required to run.</li>
<li><strong>First-class Container Security</strong> - We will continue to build out our container scanning capabilities to provide GA support for production container scanning and reduce noise overall.</li>
<li><strong>Machine Learning</strong> - We will begin to leverage aspects of machine learning to make "intelligent" recommendations to users about how to reduce their security risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=what-were-not-doing>What We're Not Doing</h3>
<p>The following will NOT be a focus over the next 12 months:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security services</strong> - The cybersecurity staffing shortage <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/martenmickos/2019/06/19/the-cybersecurity-skills-gap-wont-be-solved-in-a-classroom/#79a380dd1c30">continues to grow</a> with no solvable solution yet defined. To solve this issue, organizations have been relying on security services to fill this gap in their security processes. As part of Secure’s 3 Year Strategy, we want to address this for the GitLab community by offering cybersecurity augmentation powered by GitLab Secure categories.</li>
<li><strong>SIEM functionality</strong> - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions are a common tool leveraged by IT Ops and SecOps organizations to monitor for events within their production environments.</li>
<li><strong>Non-cloud native environments</strong> - Enterprises are undergoing cloud-native transformations shifting from traditional data centers to public cloud environments leveraging technologies like Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=target-audience>Target audience</h2>
<p>GitLab identifies who our DevSecOps application is built for utilizing the following categorization. We list our view of who we will support when in priority order.</p>
<ul>
<li>🟩- Targeted with strong support</li>
<li>🟨- Targeted but incomplete support</li>
<li>⬜️- Not targeted but might find value</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=today>Today</h3>
<p>To capitalize on the <a href="#opportunities">opportunities</a> listed above, the Sec Section has features that make it useful to the following personas today.</p>
<ol>
<li>🟩 Developers / Development Teams</li>
<li>🟩 Security Teams</li>
<li>🟨 SecOps Teams</li>
<li>🟨 QA engineers / QA Teams</li>
<li>⬜️ Security Consultants</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=medium-term-1-2-years>Medium Term (1-2 years)</h3>
<p>As we execute our <a href="#3-year-strategy">3 year strategy</a>, our medium term (1-2 year) goal is to provide a single DevSecOps application that enables collaboration between developers, security teams, SecOps teams, and QA Teams.</p>
<ol>
<li>🟩 Developers / Development Teams</li>

</ol>
<h2 id=stages-and-categories>Stages and Categories</h2>
<p>The Sec section is composed of two stages, <a href="/direction/secure/">Secure</a> and <a href="/direction/govern/">Govern</a>, each of which contains several categories. Each stage has an overall
strategy statement below, aligned to the themes for Sec. Each category within each stage has a dedicated direction page
plus optional documentation, marketing pages, and other materials linked below.</p>
<h3 id=secure>Secure</h3>
<p>The <a href="/direction/secure/">Secure stage</a> enables accurate, automated, and continuous assessment of your applications and services enabling you to proactively identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses to minimize your security risk. Secure is not an additional step in your process nor an additional tool to introduce to your process. it is woven into your DevOps cycle thus allowing you to adapt your security testing and processes to your developers (and not the other way around).</p>
<h4 id=categories>Categories</h4>
<h5 id=sast>SAST</h5>
<p>Scans your application source code and binaries to spot potential vulnerabilities before deployment. SAST supports scanning a variety of different programming languages and automatically chooses the right analyzer even if your project uses more than one language.

<h5 id=attack-emulation>Attack Emulation</h5>
<p>Continuously assess your applications and services are not vulnerable to security threats through automated, real-world emulated scenarios to identify weaknesses in your attack surface</p>
<p>Priority: low</p>
<h4 id=pricing>Pricing</h4>
<p>Secure is focused on providing enterprise-grade application security testing (AST) capabilities to minimize overall risk. The intent is to provide enough value in paid features so as to allow Secure to contribute in a significant way over the next 3 years toward GitLab's <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/">company-level financial goals</a>.</p>
<p>Although paid features are the primary focus, there are several reasons why features for unpaid tiers might be prioritized above paid features:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Secure stage has a powerful potential to help improve the security of projects everywhere. Features with the potential to significantly improve the security posture of all projects will be highly prioritized and made available in an unpaid tier.</li>
<li>To continue to be <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/stewardship/">good stewards in the open source community</a>, any basic integration with open source projects will be available in an unpaid tier by default, along with the "table stakes" set of functionality required to allow that feature to be usable with GitLab. Any open source project integrations that currently exist in paid tiers will have a discussion opened about moving the integration to an unpaid tier.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id=corefree>Core/Free</h5>
<p>This tier is the primary way to increase broad adoption of the Secure stage, as well as encouraging community contributions and improving security across the entire GitLab user base.</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, features will fall in the Core/Free tier when they meet one or more of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The feature is primarily for an individual with a few small projects rather than meeting the needs of an organization or enterprise that is operating at scale</li>
<li>The feature is provided by an integration with an open source project rather than being natively developed by GitLab</li>
<li>The feature has the potential to increase the security posture of all GitLab projects in a significant way, or there is a reasonable ethical/moral obligation to make the feature available to all users</li>
<li>The ongoing cost for GitLab to maintain and update the feature is relatively minimal</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic installation and use of scanners, especially when the underlying scanner is taken from an open source project</li>
<li>The basic ability to retrieve scan results in some way</li>
<li>Documentation and directions on how to install and configure a scanner</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=premiumsilver>Premium/Silver</h5>
<p>This tier is not a significant part of Secure's pricing strategy.</p>
<h5 id=ultimategold>Ultimate/Gold</h5>
<p>This tier is the primary focus for the Secure stage as the security posture of an organization is typically a primary concern of the executive team and even the board of directors. Just as a major security incident has far reaching consequences that impact the entirety of an organization, the features and capabilities that enable organizations to assess their overall security risk tend to be valued with equal weight. The types of capabilities that fall in the Ultimate/Gold tier vs an unpaid tier should be those that are necessary for an organization, rather than an individual, to properly secure their code before pushing it into a production environment.</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, features will fall in the Ultimate/Gold tier when they meet one or more of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The feature is focused on enabling an organization or enterprise to operate at scale rather than an individual with a few smaller personal projects</li>
<li>The feature is natively developed or <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/acquisitions/">acquired</a> by GitLab rather than being provided by an open source project</li>
<li>The feature has a significant ongoing cost for GitLab to maintain and update the feature</li>
</ul>

<h3 id=govern>Govern</h3>
<p>The <a href="/direction/govern/">Govern stage</a> helps organizations to reduce their overall risk by applying appropriate management and governance oversight across the entire DevSecOps lifecycle. Govern provides management tools to secure the GitLab platform itself by restricting access to authenticated users and ensuring they are provisioned with the least amount of required privileges. To help manage and monitor risk levels, the Govern stage provides visibility into user permissions and activity; project dependencies; security findings; and aderence to compliance standards. This visibility is then coupled with enforcement capabilities to proactively prevent risks by automating compliance and securing the software supply chain.</p>
<h4 id=categories-1>Categories</h4>
<h5 id=user-management>User Management</h5>
<p>User Management provides tools to administer users and their attributes. From GitLab you can provision users, configure access control, manage user settings, and review user attributes.</p>

<h4 id=pricing-1>Pricing</h4>
<p>Govern is focused on providing governance and compliance features that span across the DevSecOps lifecycle. Govern’s tiering strategy aligns with the GitLab approach of selecting the tier based on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/pricing/#three-tiers">who cares most about the feature</a>. Because Executives generally care most about governance features, it is expected that most Govern features will land in the Ultimate tier.</p>
<h5 id=free>Free</h5>
<p>This tier is the primary way to increase broad adoption of the Govern stage, as well as encouraging community contributions and improving security across the entire GitLab user base.</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, features will fall in the Free tier when they meet one or more of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The feature is highly useful for an individual with a few small projects rather than meeting the needs of an organization or enterprise that is operating at scale.</li>
<li>The feature is provided by an integration with an open source project rather than being natively developed by GitLab.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id=premium>Premium</h5>
<p>This tier is not a significant part of Govern's pricing strategy; however, a few features features that primarily appeal to Directors rather than Executives may fall into the Premium tier. One example of this is our audit event functionality that is available in this tier.</p>
<h5 id=ultimate>Ultimate</h5>
<p>This tier is the primary focus for the Govern stage as most Govern features enable executives to ensure that their organization meets compliance requirements and maintains an acceptable security posture.</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, features will fall in the Ultimate tier when they meet one or more of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The feature is focused on enabling an organization or enterprise to operate at scale rather than an individual with a few small projects.</li>
<li>The feature is natively developed by GitLab rather than being provided by an open source project.</li>
