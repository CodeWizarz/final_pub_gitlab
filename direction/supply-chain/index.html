<p>The Sec Section maintains GitLab's vision for <a href="/solutions/supply-chain/">Software Supply Chain Security (SSCS)</a> and leads coordination across the many stages that are involved in delivering a comprehensive, quality secure supply chain experience at GitLab. These include, but are not necessarily limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/direction/dev/#create">Create</a></li>
<li><a href="/direction/verify/verify">Verify</a></li>
<li><a href="/direction/package/">Package</a></li>
<li><a href="/direction/delivery/">Deploy</a></li>
<li><a href="/direction/secure/">Secure</a></li>
<li><a href="/direction/govern/">Govern</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This direction page is intended to help facilitate cross-stage collaboration as well as to provide a single reference describing our vision for the product capabilities that comprise our SSCS solution. The end goal is to deliver a single tool that gives users confidence in the integrity and security of their software supply chain.</p>
<p>Because this page represents our long-term vision, it extends beyond our current product roadmap to describe the ideal future state of GitLab. Please reference the individual epics/issues in GitLab to track progress toward accomplishing this vision.</p>
<h2 id=overview>Overview</h2>
<p>An emerging concern in the software development space is being able to document the entire supply chain and development progress by creating a chain of custody starting from code creation, build, test, package, and going through deployment. One important element of this chain of custody is commonly referred to as a Software Bill of Materials <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/SBOM">SBOM</a>. There are also frameworks, such as <a href="https://slsa.dev/">SLSA</a> which collect additional elements about the process. Together these documents are becoming critical components to satisfying regulated industry requirements.</p>
<p>Software Supply Chain Security includes everything needed to securely deliver and run software with a high degree of confidence that not only your software, but also its surrounding cloud native infrastructure has not been compromised. GitLab has put together a framework describing the various aspects that are required to accomplish this based on feedback from customers, inspiration from common standards (such as SLSA), as well as thought leadership from industry analysts. Please note however, that this framework is not necessarily representative of any other entity's opinion or perspective on the SSCS space.</p>
<p><img src="/images/direction/supply-chain/SSCS_framework.png" alt="GitLab Software Supply Chain Security Framework"/></p>
<p>We believe that there are five main aspects to consider when providing for a secure end-to-end software supply chain.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Source</strong> - includes the controls needed to be confident that both internal and external source code is safe from vulnerabilities and has not been compromised in any way.</li>
<li><strong>Build</strong> - includes rigorous requirements for the security and isolation of build environments as well as the automatic generation of provenance.</li>
<li><strong>Consumption</strong> - includes the ability to validate authenticity and source of any executed binaries. Supports requirements for securing the underlying host infrastructure itself.</li>
<li><strong>Management Process</strong> - this component spans across all other aspects of SSCS and includes both the tools and processes necessary to provide for ongoing visibility into compliance SSCS requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Security</strong> - this component spans across all other aspects of SSCS and includes the adoption of best practices for managing the security of the underlying tools themselves.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=current-position-and-vision>Current Position and Vision</h2>
<p>The state of GitLab product capabilities required to address each of the five aspects of SSCS currently spans the spectrum from vision items to complete features:</p>
<h3 id=source>Source</h3>
<p>The approach for protecting code sources can be subdivided by thinking about protection for Internal Sources separately from protection for External Sources.</p>

<h2 id=strategy>Strategy</h2>
<p>In the long-term, our strategy is to become a complete provider for all aspects of software supply chain security. Providing all of these aspects within a single application not only supports GitLab's broader <a href="/handbook/source/handbook/product/single-application">Single Application Strategy</a> but also provides numerous tangible benefits for users.</p>
<p>Among other things, using a single application:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimizes the number of different tools that need to be hardened and monitored.</li>
<li>reduces the number of potential points of security failure as data is transferred between various tools.</li>
<li>enables seamless interoperability.</li>
<li>simplifies visibility and traceability for audits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=highlighted-epics-and-issues>Highlighted epics and issues</h2>
<p>There are a few epics and important issues you can check out to see where we're headed. More will be added here as we develop this vision further.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8226">Dependency Management Vision</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6207">Artifact Data Store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5135">Release Evidence Viability</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id=whats-next--why>What's next &amp; why</h2>
<p>Although we support <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/signing_examples.html">signing of build artifacts through Sigstore</a>, the user experience for signed container images in GitLab is not ideal as signatures show up on a separate line item from the container image that they have signed. In 16.11 we plan to address this by associating container images with their signatures in the UI to make it easier to see which images are signed and to more easily validate those signatures.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are continuing ongoing work to explore whether we can automatically sign build artifacts natively in the GitLab Runner. Automatic signing is believed to be the best way to get widespread adoption of signing.</p>
<p>A full list of the SSCS working group's current priorities can be viewed <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/working-groups/software-supply-chain-security/#priorities-and-progress">on this working group page</a>.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-we-not-doing>What are we not doing</h2>
<p>Sigstore currently has two key limitations that impact GitLab:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sigstore does not have a Ruby library</li>
<li>Sigstore does not have good support for deploying and running a self managed Sigstore instance</li>
</ol>
<p>We do not currently plan to address either of these limitations directly and instead are hoping to work with the wider community to find alternate solutions. Because of these feature gaps, we do not plan on adding support for our Sigstore integration for self managed instances. We also are limited in our ability to natively validate Sigstore signatures within GitLab due to the lack of Ruby support.</p>
<h2 id=competitive-landscape>Competitive landscape</h2>
<p>There have been indications that Tekton and Sigstore are tools representing a leader in software supply chain security. One example of how this has been used in practice can be found in this <a href="https://dlorenc.medium.com/zero-trust-supply-chain-security-e3fb8b6973b8">blog</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sigstore/cosign#registry-support">CoSign</a> is an open source tool that can be used for container signing.</p>
<p><a href="https://grafeas.io/">Grafeas</a> is an open-source artifact metadata datastore tool which offers flexible, universal artifact metadata storage - a key foundation for software supply chain security.</p>
<h2 id=frameworks>Frameworks</h2>
<p><strong>Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://slsa.dev/">SLSA framework</a> is an open source specification that is primarily focused on preventing artifacts from being tampered with as they are coded, developed, and published. Our vision for SSCS includes adding native support for SLSA with the objective of eventually fully supporting all the way up to SLSA level 3. GitLab already supports users who want to attain SLSA L1. GitLab is currently exploring ways to natively generate the required provenance data for SLSA as part of its Runner that does the build. For more details on SLSA, view the <a href="https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/requirements">SLSA requirements</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Update Framework (TUF)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md#the-update-framework-specification">The Update Framework (TUF)</a> is an open source specification for that provides instructions on how to organize, sign, and interact with metadata to secure package managers. Our vision for SSCS includes adding native support for TUF in the future by including the required metadata in the software provenance that we plan to generate and by validating signatures at each step of the software lifecycle. TUF leverages a Kritis store to manage metadata from in-toto. TUF recommends the use of an OCI image-spec container registry, aligned with our Container Registry's <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/container_registry_metadata_database/#new-features-and-breaking-changes">documentation</a>. Some gaps to consider for GitLab are the rotation of secrets and key management, which is a part of <a href="/direction/verify/secrets_management/">Secrets Management direction</a>.
TUF also recommends the <a href="/direction/delivery/deployment_management/">verification of deployments</a>.
For more details on TUF, view the <a href="https://project.linuxfoundation.org/hubfs/CNCF_SSCP_v1.pdf">CNCF TUF specifications</a>.</p>
<h2 id=north-stars>North Stars</h2>
<p>A FY23 theme for the <a href="/direction/verify/verify">Verify Stage</a> is to support pipeline safety throughout the software development lifecycle to automatically ensure compliance and security.
