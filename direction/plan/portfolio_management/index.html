<h3 id=1-year-roadmap>1 Year Roadmap</h3>
<p>Our 1 year focus is to provide planning solutions that provide visibility into the success of your plans, bridge the gap between different teams and empowers you to confidently make planning decisions. By focusing on this direction, we aim to deliver a range of features that streamline your workflows and empower every user to contribute meaningfully. Let's delve into the roadmap and discover how it will transform your project management experience!</p>
<p>Currently, we are diligently working on achieving feature parity to enable the <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9290">migration of epics to work items</a>. This migration will leverage the powerful capabilities of the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/work_items/">work items framework</a>, which establishes a common backend for records such as epics and issues. By harnessing this framework, we can provide a consistent and streamlined experience across various planning workflows in GitLab.</p>
<p>The best part is that you, as a user, won't have to take any action—we will seamlessly migrate your data. You may notice some differences in the user interface, but rest assured, these changes will enhance your overall experience.</p>
<p>The work items framework brings several benefits to the table. First, it enables the reuse of components, allowing for more efficient development and deployment of new features. This means that our team can deliver enhancements at an accelerated pace, and users will have a more consistent experience. Second, the framework enables easier hierarchical aggregation of data, enabling better organization and management of complex projects. Third, it minimizes maintenance overhead, ensuring a more stable and reliable platform.</p>
<p>Once migrated to the work items framework, we will automatically unlock a wide array of enhancements that will significantly boost your productivity and efficiency. For example, adding Assignees or Design Management to Epics will be fairly low effort. It will also be much simpler to introduce additional work item types, like <a href="https://scaledagileframework.com/strategic-themes/">Strategic Themes</a>, to represent other critical objects in Portfolio Planning.</p>
<p>Following the successful implementation of work items, we will shift our focus to <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7108">enhancing Enterprise Agile Planning workflows</a>. Our plan includes the implementation of our vision for <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5516">Improved Data Filtering and Visualization</a>, empowering advanced capabilities to manage, retrieve and analyze your data effectively.</p>
<p>The Improved Data Filtering and Visualization initiative aims to address user problems related to navigating and filtering data by creating a centralized experience which provides users with a single page where they can effortlessly create complex queries and view data in various formats such as lists, grids, boards, and roadmaps. We aim to streamline the user experience and empower users to customize their data visualization according to their specific needs. Additionally, users will have the ability to save their built queries for personal or team use, fostering collaboration and enhancing productivity. With this initiative, we expect users to easily access and manipulate data, visualize it in meaningful ways, and accomplish their tasks with improved efficiency and clarity. In tandem with this initiative, we will look for opportunities to <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10501">improve workflow efficiency by preventing the need to open multiple tabs</a> during routine jobs to be done.</p>
<p><img src="/direction/plan/portfolio_management/saved_view.png" alt="epicstree-direction.png"/></p>
<p>Furthermore, we are committed to improving GitLab's roadmap experience by incorporating comprehensive delivery planning features that our users have expressed a strong desire for. You can explore these exciting features <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2649#roadmap-features-users-want">here</a> and we encourage you to leave your valuable feedback as well as any suggestions for additional features that may not have been mentioned. Your input is essential in shaping the future of our product to better meet your needs.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we'll begin to work on our long-term vision of expanding <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9742">dependency visibility</a> throughout the planning and execution phases. With a comprehensive understanding of dependencies, you'll have better insights into potential bottlenecks and can proactively address them, create realistic and achievable roadmaps, align tasks and deliverables across teams and ultimately drive successful product development.</p>
<p>In summary, our direction involves migrating to work items, which will bring numerous benefits to your experience. We are committed to continuously improving our platform, and our focus will shift to enhancing Enterprise Agile Planning workflows once the epic migration to work items is complete. With our upcoming initiatives, including Improved Data Filtering and Visualization and comprehensive delivery planning features, we aim to provide you with a powerful and intuitive portfolio management experience. Furthermore, improved dependency visibility will empower you with even greater insights, control, and trust in your product plans.</p>
<h4 id=what-we-are-currently-working-on>What we are currently working on</h4>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11198">Parent widget for the work items framework</a>. You will now be able to add or change the parent record within the work item record (tasks, OKRs) without having to navigate to a new page.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9290">Feature parity for epic migration to work items</a>. As preparation for the migration to the work items framework, we've been shipping epic features behind a feature flag. We are ambitiously targetting releasing the new experience in July 2024.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6033">Converting epics to work items</a> - Epics and Issues have different data elements and behaviors, which leads to confusion for our users. Epics are only available at the group level, which significantly decreases their reach. We will collaborate with the Project Management group to build the capabilities that Epics need into the Work Items framework. Our first iteration of this was building the concept of parent/child relationships which was used for <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/tasks.html#tasks">tasks</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4231">Epic Assignees</a>. You will now assign epics to individuals, making it clear who is responsible for overseeing the progress. This allows for better visibility into work ownership, streamlined communication, and easier tracking of project status.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/414858">Allow users to choose a custom color picker for epics</a>. Expanding the feature to allow users to associate a color with epics for visual differentiation on roadmaps and boards, users will now have the ability to define a custom color, using HEX or RGB codes, or choose from an expanded predefined palette.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id=next-up>Next up</h4>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5516">Improved Data Filtering and Visualization</a> - It’s hard to query, save and share planning data with others. We plan to allow users to save a filtered list of their work item data so that they can easily come back to and share a list of work items. An example use cases is how at GitLab we frequently monitor our backlog for security issues and take that into account with every milestone plan. In the future, product managers and engineering team leads could have a shared saved query that surfaces all the security issues that have not been prioritized for their group.</li>
<li>Improvements to increase the maturity of <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2649">Roadmaps</a> - Roadmaps are an industry standard way in which plans are visualized, and are key to an experience that is lovable by product and project managers. Key functionality like drag and drop editing are missing from our current implementation.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id=what-we-recently-completed>What we recently completed</h4>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/468187">Real-time Board Updates for a Smoother Workflow</a>. You'll now notice a smoother experience when updating issues on boards! Changes you make in the sidebar will instantly appear on the board itself, no more refreshing required. This reactive boards experience streamlines your workflow, allowing you to quickly make updates while seeing them reflected in real-time. <strong>17.1</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/460492">Sort the Roadmap by created date, last updated date, and title</a>. We expanded the epic sorting options available in the Roadmap view, providing you more flexibility in organizing and prioritizing your projects. You can now sort epics by <strong>created date</strong>, <strong>last updated date</strong>, and <strong>title</strong>.

<h4 id=what-is-not-planned-right-now>What is Not Planned Right Now</h4>
<p>In the next two years:</p>
<ul>
<li>We plan to build a flexible planning tool that can be configured to implement SAFe. We do not plan to implement a system that is optimized for SAFe only.</li>
<li>In order to meet the Portfolio Management vision described in this page, we have decreased investment in our Requirements Management, Test Management and Design Management categories. We will continue to address defects and support community contributions but we are not planning to make significant improvements.</li>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Portfolio financial management</td>
<td>Visibility and insight into funding capacity rather than projects. Instead of determining how much it will cost to achieve the next two milestones, managers determine how much capacity is required to deliver a consistent flow of value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Portfolio level planning</td>
<td>Identifying which programs to invest in, and how much. Portfolios are largely trying to figure out what initiative to fund, based on when the previous one is scheduled to finish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Program level planning</td>
<td>Breaking large deliverables into chunks that make sense for each team and coordinating the teams' work. Programs need to worry about dependencies and coordination.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Enterprise agile framework (including SAFe)</td>
<td>SAFe support includes the processes, roles, and artifacts that enable scaling across teams, and the ability to plan and track work and assess economic benefits using at a minimum Portfolio SAFe in SAFe v. 5.0. EAP tools may support multiple enterprise agile frameworks commonly used in the industry.</td>
</tr>

<td>Forecasting</td>
<td><a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/agile-forecasting-techniques-next-decade#:~:text=A%20forecast%20is%20a%20calculation%20about%20the%20future%20completion%20of%20an%20item%20or%20items%20that%20includes%20both%20a%20date%20range%20and%20a%20probability.">A forecast is a calculation about the future completion of an item or items that includes both a date range and a probability.</a> Forecasts take the progress to date of all of the programs, then make forward-looking predictions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dependency management</td>
<td>Dependencies are the relationships between work that determine the order in which the work items (features, stories, tasks) must be completed by Agile teams. Dependency management is the process of actively analyzing, measuring, and working to minimize the disruption caused by intra-team and / or cross-team dependencies.</td>
</tr>

<li>Based on strong reviews from Gartner, Forrester, Peer Insights, and my own user review, Jira Align is the <strong>top competitor</strong> in the Enterprise Agile Planning space due to its full support for enterprise agile frameworks such as SAFe, excellent roadmapping, forecasting, dependency management, and collaboration capabilities. While Planview and Digital.ai also scored high with analysts, I found their UX heavy and dated. Jira Align scores well in portfolio management functionality and usability.</li>
