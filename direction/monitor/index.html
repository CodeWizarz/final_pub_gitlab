<h1 id=what-we-do>What we do</h1>
<h2 id=vision>Vision</h2>
<p>Our vision is to continue to extend DevOps across its most painful gap - measuring user value.</p>
<p>We heard a collection of common questions when talking with users.</p>
<p>Some of these were:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I be sure that the application is achieving the goals I have?</li>
<li>Are users not using a new feature because the app is not performant or because the feature isn't addressing their use case?</li>
<li>Where should I focus my efforts on improving my product in future releases?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Analytics Section closes the DevOps loop. It is not enough to deploy an app and hope for the best. It is critical to understand when an application is behaving as intended and that users are getting the expected value.</p>
<p>We provide app owners and developers the tools to understand when their application is behaving properly (or not) and then to
learn about how users engage with the app. This allows app owners to move beyond only focusing on improving efficiency to instead focusing on improving effectiveness.</p>
<h2 id=composition>Composition</h2>
<p>The Analytics Section is comprised of a single Stage, the Monitor stage. This stage has three groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/monitor/product-analytics">Product Analytics</a>
<ul>
<li>Product Analytics Visualization category</li>
<li>Product Analytics Data Management category</li>
</ul>
<p>The Product Analytics group focuses on allowing users to analyze product data to uncover insights about how their apps are being used. This is done through preconfigured dashboard and reports as well as enabling users to build their own dashboards and reports.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/monitor/analytics-instrumentation">Analytics Instrumentation</a>
<ul>
<li>Service Ping category</li>
<li>Application Instrumentation category</li>
</ul>
<p>The Analytics Instrumentation group focuses on empowering both internal and external users to send usage data to GitLab by providing SDKs and a stable reporting platform. Internally, this means tools like Service Ping and Snowplow as well as providing support to the groups that use them. External users will use the SDK that this group publishes to instrument their own apps.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/direction/monitor/observability/">Observability</a>
<ul>
<li>Error Tracking category</li>
<li>Tracing category</li>
<li>Metrics category</li>
<li>Logging category</li>
</ul>
<p>The Observability group focuses on providing visibility into the health of running applications and how they are performing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=the-analytics-section-does-not-include-all-analytics-in-gitlab>The Analytics section DOES NOT INCLUDE all analytics in GitLab</h3>
<p>Despite the name, the Analytics section doesn't encompass all analytics capabilities in GitLab. Categories like <a href="/handbook/product/categories/features/#manageoptimize-group">Value Stream Analytics</a> and capabilities like <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#issues-analytics">Issue Analytics</a>, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/#release-metrics">Release Metrics</a>, or <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/ci_cd_analytics.html">CI/CD analytics</a> analytics those are not within the scope of the Analytics section.</p>
<h2 id=cross-stage-vision-for-gitlab-usage-analytics>Cross-stage vision for GitLab usage analytics</h2>
<p>We know that many groups and teams within GitLab as well as users rely on data to understand how they are using GitLab. There are multiple approaches to produce and consume data currently, which introduces confusion and friction. Our long-term vision is to unify these so that there is a Single Source of Truth for both how to record data about how GitLab is being used as well as how to consume it. There are additional details on this vision at our <a href="/direction/monitor/cross-stage-vision.html">cross-stage directional vision</a> page.</p>
<h1 id=how-we-do-it>How we do it</h1>
<h2 id=personas>Personas</h2>
<h3 id=observability>Observability</h3>
<p>See Observability <a href="./observability/#target-audience">target audience</a></p>
<h3 id=product-analytics>Product Analytics</h3>
<p>The primary personas we address, in priority order, are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/handbook/product/personas/#sasha-software-developer">Sasha - Software Developer</a></li>
<li><a href="/handbook/product/personas/#parker-product-manager">Parker - Product Manager</a></li>
</ol>
<p>We may need <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/4273">additional personas</a> in the future.</p>
<p>Some nuance can be added to our personas and how we approach them. Nearly all analytics questions, workflows, funnels, or any metrics gathering will require technical work to add instrumentation, test, and deploy it. This is the reason we are focusing on Sasha as our primary persona before Parker. We are addressing Sasha in the context that they are supporting Analytics efforts for their team. This means they are interested in how to do tasks related to adding instrumentation code, deploying it, and debugging it in support of analytics-related questions and projects. This is a more focused version of the Sasha overall persona.</p>
<p>As part of considering these personas, consider what personas we are <em>not</em> including in this initial list. Specifically, we are not targeting executive personas or Directors with the initial offering. Sasha and Parker are individual contributors and have unique needs different than Directors or executives. They are focused mainly on specific applications and the analytics related to them, whereas executives and Directors will be concerned about multiple, or a "fleet", of applications. We intend to go after these personas eventually and will not intentionally create capabilities that exclude them, but they are not our primary focus at this point.</p>
<p>Both of these personas exist on our users' teams and they also exist on our own GitLab team. Our internal members share many of the same use cases and pain points as our external users. We keep this in mind when developing features and capabilities and try to dogfood as much as possible. We also need to remain mindful that while we share many use cases, we will not have <em>all</em> use cases our external users have, so we should not build only for ourselves and not validate with external users. This aligns with our <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#:~:text=You%E2%80%99re%20not%20the%20customer.">you're not the customer</a> product principle.</p>
<h2 id=right-to-win>Right to Win</h2>
<p>We have the right to win in this Section because:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The value stream delivery process is integrating</strong> - Gartner’s market definition of Value Stream Delivery Platforms ends at Deployment today. We expect it to extend to Monitor and then the outer-loop. If we don’t capture this market as part of our platform - someone else will.</li>
<li><strong>Developer experience is key</strong> - The current market is broken by poor developer experience. Capturing User Engagement insights in digital products requires developers. We already capture developer workflow, and we know how to delight developers.</li>
<li><strong>Our distribution models are disruptive</strong> - Our bottom’s up distribution model allows for adoption without displacement. Developers in larger organizations can instrument and utilize GitLab’s outer-loop categories alongside existing tools. In smaller organizations, they can utilize outer-loop tools as an alternative to using no tool.</li>
<li><strong>We are trusted</strong> - User data, like code - is sensitive data. The focus against third-party ownership of user data, and our availability as a SaaS and self-managed platform allow us to leverage the trust we’ve built as an open-source and transparent company. We are able to develop open-standards for data-storage, and enable contribution to how we handle data to ensure our users can trust it is safe.</li>
<li><strong>The single DevOps Platform unlocks unique technical possibilities</strong> - GitLab stores our users source code, issues, vulnerability records, and other project info. This gives us the opportunity to do associations and correlations that will not be possible to do (or at least not easily) on a standalone analytics product.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=product-principles>Product Principles</h2>
<p>We will pursue this opportunity with the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/handbook/product/product-principles/#developer-first">Focus on Developers</a> - We have established relationships with them, and they are key to building an onramp to the product and a <a href="/company/strategy/#dual-flywheels">dual flywheel</a> to our strategy.</li>
<li><a href="/handbook/product/product-principles/#configuration-principles">Works by Default</a> - The way we can establish bottom-up disruption is by making outer-loop categories available, on-by-default in every GitLab instance.</li>
<li><a href="/handbook/product/product-principles/#prioritize-current-adopters">Focus on Next Generation Adopters</a> - Every company is becoming a software company, there are many more software experiences to be written than our written today. The market of tools spanning the outer-loop is segmenting and consolidating, there are many organizations who will be new to it. Focusing on them will allow us to concentrate our R&amp;D effort on future platform growth rather than integration with existing vendors.</li>
<li><a href="/handbook/product/product-principles/#avoid-not-invented-here-syndrome">Integrate Open Source Standards</a> - We will stand on the shoulders of giants and use open-source standards, particularly when considering product analytics instrumentation.</li>
<li><a href="/handbook/product/product-processes/#dogfood-everything">Dogfood</a> - We should be our own first customer, utilizing our outer-loop capabilities to drive GitLab’s Product Led Growth amongst developers in order to accelerate our learning cycles.</li>
<li><a href="/handbook/product/product-principles/#our-product-principles">Start with the problem, not the solution.</a> - We will focus on what is impactful for our users and solves real problems for them. There will be temptations to record more data or create more views but we will not do so unless we can first identify who would want to use that and what they would use it for.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=1-year-plan>1 Year Plan</h2>
<p>Our 1 year plan is to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Launch a General Availability version of Observability</strong> - We will enable customers to collect telemetry data (logs, traces, metrics) to visualize and analyze their applications and infrastructure performance within GitLab (<a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/opstrace/-/epics/92">see epic</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Launch a General Availability version of Product Analytics</strong> - We will enable customers to use GitLab's Product Analytics in their own applications to understand their users and uncover insights. We are currently dogfooding our <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8462">internal preview</a> and are working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8525">customer facing releases</a> now.</li>
<li><strong>Enhance our unified instrumentation approach</strong> - We recently introduced a unified instrumentation method for Product Analytics, called <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/internal_analytics/">internal event tracking</a>, which allows seamless data tracking within GitLab, eliminating the need to delve into the intricacies of Snowplow, Redis, or Redis HLL. Our ongoing commitment is to iterate and improve on this, with the ultimate objective of encouraging more internal teams to effortlessly and promptly instrument their features.</li>
<li><strong>Customer access to usage data</strong> - In pursuit of our overarching goal to achieve the <a href="/direction/monitor/cross-stage-vision.html">cross-stage data vision</a>, we will work towards enhancing accessibility of usage data for our SAAS and self-managed customers</li>
<li><strong>Dogfood everything we build</strong> - Dogfooding allows us to experience what our users experience - for better or worse. By using our own product, we can identify what needs to be fixed and better understand our users. Dogfooding Product Analytics in the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">Internal Handbook</a> and starting to use our <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9610">new instrumentation approaches</a> will give us valuable feedback to iterate on.</li>
<li><strong>Support the ongoing needs of GitLab in understanding our own users</strong> - GitLab relies on our existing instrumentation and metrics frameworks, such as Service Ping, Redis, and Snowplow, to make data-driven decisions. We will remain focused on ensuring these are robust, scalable, and address any issues that arise.</li>

<h3 id=deployment-approaches>Deployment approaches</h3>
<p>The Monitor stage offerings for both Product Analytics and Observability will require separate infrastructure from what GitLab runs on today.
This is due to the need to leverage technologies like ClickHouse, Snowplow, Cube.dev, and others.
We have different requirements than the Rails monolith with respect to qualities such as data ingestion, and horizontal scalability as part of providing a data management platform.
We are exploring this as part of an internal <a href="https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/internal-working-groups/product-usage-data-architecture/">working group</a>.
We will provide multiple different deployment options for this for GitLab.com, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/">GitLab Dedicated</a>, and self-managed deployments of GitLab.</p>
<p>One deployment option is for allowing Bring-Your-Own-Cluster or BYOC. In this deployment
option, users will need to configure, run, and connect all of their own infrastructure to GitLab.
This can work for GitLab.com, Dedicated, and self-managed. It lets users maintain full control over
all their data and infrastructure at the expense of having to manage, scale, and support it themselves.</p>
<p>The other deployment option is to allow GitLab Inc to manage the required infrastructure. In this
deployment option, users will be given URLs and API tokens that they can use to connect to pre-configured
infrastructure. This means they can use it directly and not have to worry about scaling or managing it
themselves. This will work on GitLab.com since we will connect a cluster directly to it. It will also
work for GitLab Dedicated and self-managed customers by leveraging our <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/cloud_connector/">cloud connector</a>
functionality.</p>
<p>Today, both Observability and Product Analytics can be used on GitLab.com with the managed infrastructure approach.
For Observability, only the cloud connector approach is available to Dedicated and self-managed users and in a beta state.
In contrast, only the BYOC approach is available for Product Analytics for Dedicated and self-managed users.</p>
<p>Customers will choose one to use but it does not mean they are mutually exclusive from GitLab's perspective in terms of which to implement.
Our ideal state is that both approaches are available for customers to choose from.
Primarily it is a sequencing decision on which we will develop first and which second.</p>
<p>We will first focus on enabling the BYOC deployment option for Observability.
We will then work on enabling the cloud connector approach for Product Analytics.
This approach will let us create a BYOC option that can be released in a GA capacity more quickly than doing it in the opposite order.
Providing a managed version via cloud connector requires additional operational support and maintenance after the initial release that will take longer
for us to be in a position to provide. In contrast, we can create a BYOC version of observability, modeled after the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/analytics-section/product-analytics/helm-charts">BYOC of Product Analytics</a>, in a shorter time.</p>

<h2 id=impact>Impact</h2>
<p>The Monitor stage will further extend GitLab's lead in being the One DevOps platform by consolidating yet another set of existing tools required to deliver software value to users.</p>
<h2 id=market>Market</h2>
<p>All current DevOps platforms define their water's edge at Monitoring - ensuring a deployed idea is available and performant for users. The process of visualizing and learning from usage, collecting and organizing feedback, engaging and enabling users - those are all left to specialist vendors positioning their products at Marketing, Growth and Product teams. We feel this gives us an opportunity to combine these use cases and combine them with the rest of the GitLab platform to provide more value to our users.</p>
