Some common controls are noted below.</p>
<p><strong>Does GitLab encrypt my data in transit and at rest?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. GitLab, Inc utilizes TLS Strict, HTTPS, and Universal SSL to encrypt data in transit. Data is encrypted at rest using Google Cloud Platform supporting AES-256.</p>
<p><strong>Does GitLab have an incident response plan?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. GitLab, Inc has a dedicated <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-operations/sirt/sec-incident-response/">Security Incident Response team</a> and a documented <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-operations/sirt/#-incident-management-and-review">Incident Management Plan</a> that includes identification, containment, remediation and communication throughout the lifecycle of an incident.</p>
<p><strong>Does GitLab regularly undergo penetration testing by a 3rd party firm?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. GitLab, Inc contracts with a third party service provider to conduct annual penetration tests of our infrastructure and product.

<p><strong>What are GitLabs RTO and RPO times?</strong></p>
<p>GitLab does not currently have a stated RTO/RPO for GitLab.com Disaster Recovery. Establishing stated goals as part of our recovery capabilities is an important goal for GitLab during 2023. In accordance with our focus on transparency, we will only provide these values when they can be relied upon based on actual test results of simulated disaster recovery scenarios. We welcome familiarization with our <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/production/architecture/">SaaS architecture</a> as well as how we <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/monitoring/">monitor for availability</a>. We look forward to providing similar insight into our disaster recovery approach by the end of 2023.</p>
<h3 id=gitlab-product-security>GitLab Product Security</h3>
<p><strong>How does GitLab handle security releases?</strong></p>
<p>GitLab releases patches for vulnerabilities in dedicated security releases. There are two types of security releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly scheduled security release that is targeted to go out a week after the feature release (which deploys <a href="/handbook/engineering/releases/">every month</a>)</li>
<li>Ad-hoc security releases for critical vulnerabilities. The fix for every vulnerability is backported to the current release, and the 2 previous <code>major.minor</code> versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you understand the vulnerabilities that were fixed, a blog post accompanies each security release and includes a brief description, the
versions affected, and the assigned CVE ID for each vulnerability. Feature and security release blog posts are located in the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/"><code>releases</code> section of our blog</a>. In addition, the issues detailing each vulnerability are made public 30 days
after the release in which they were patched. It is highly recommended that all customers upgrade to at least the latest security release for their
supported version.</p>
<p>To be notified when a security release is released, the following channels are
available:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/company/contact/">Security Notices mailing list</a></li>
<li><a href="/security-releases.xml">Security Release RSS feed</a></li>
<li><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/all-releases.xml">All GitLab Releases RSS feed</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Can GitLab provide advance notice to customers surrounding a Security Release?</strong></p>
<p>We do not offer customers advance notice of security releases. We have two principal reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We mentioned above that regular security releases are targeted for release one week after our feature release (which deploys <a href="/handbook/engineering/releases/">every month</a>). We set the date for the security releases after the feature release, and we’re not always able to accurately pinpoint an exact release date within that seven-day window (due to manual processes that still exist and potential, unforeseen delays that can arise).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We often perform critical security releases ad-hoc, especially in cases involving a great deal of urgency. In these scenarios, providing a pre-announcement is difficult and could even delay a critical fix, putting our customers at risk. Instead, we typically release as soon as we have a fix and notify via our <a href="/company/contact/">security notices mailing list</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We understand security releases and critical fixes aren’t always convenient for our users. We’re continuing to review and refine our communications processes surrounding critical security incidents and have set a goal of a <a href="/handbook/security/security-operations/sirt/security-incident-communication-plan/#turnaround-on-customer-messaging">6 hour window for turnaround on customer communications related to an S1 severity vulnerability</a> to get critical information into users’ hands as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>The best way to stay on top of security releases and critical fixes is to subscribe to our <a href="/company/contact/">security notices mailing list</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can GitLab team members access private repositories?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. GitLab, Inc Customer Support requires access to customer repositories hosted on gitlab.com, however team members will not access private repositories unless required for support and troubleshooting. Forms of access include, but are not limited to, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/admin_area.html#user-impersonation">impersonation</a>. When working on a support issue, we strive to respect your privacy as much as possible. Once we've <a href="/handbook/support/workflows/account_verification/">verified account ownership</a>, we will only access the files and settings needed to resolve your issue. Support may sign into your account to access configurations but we will limit the scope of our review to the minimum access required to solve your issue. In the event we need to pull a clone of your code, we will only do so with your consent. All cloned repositories are deleted as soon as the support issue has been resolved. There are two exceptions to this policy on accessing private repositories: we are investigating a suspected violation of our <a href="/terms/">terms of service</a> or we are compelled to access repositories as part of a legal or security matter.</p>
<p><strong>Can GitLab be hardened?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. GitLab can be hardened and we have released information for that. It's available in blog posts and our documentation. See <a href="/security/hardening/">Hardening Your GitLab Instance</a> for more information.</p>
